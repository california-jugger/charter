# California Jugger Alliance Charter
This document describes the purpose and structure of the California Jugger Alliance, hereafter referred to as CAJA.

## MISSION STATEMENT
CAJA exists to support the growth and development of sport jugger in the state of California. Specific objectives/goals, in no particular order:

 - Serve as a discussion forum for all teams in California on any and all jugger-related matters.  
 - Facilitate tournaments and game days within California.  
 - Support the growth of new teams in California through sharing of information, material resources, and personnel.  
 - Arbitrate disputes between California teams.  
 - Perform outreach and serve as liaison with the general public and external parties, including other jugger teams or organizations outside California.

Things beyond CAJA purview:

 - Wasteland jugger.  
 - Team-internal affairs, especially disciplinary action. CAJA is a support organization, not a governing body, and only holds disciplinary authority for CAJA-specific matters. While CAJA will not initiate condemnation of individual players for misconduct not directly related to CAJA affairs, the organization may act on a team’s choice to discipline a member at the voting council’s discretion.

Longer-term objectives:

 - Obtain legal status as an organization, to more easily obtain sponsorship, insurance, funding, etc.  
 - Collect and manage funds/materials for seeding new teams.

## ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE
CAJA comprises all teams within California who voluntarily participate in the organization. The official functions of CAJA are performed by two bodies: the **voting council** and **executive committee**.

**Voting Council:** One member per active member team who votes on major matters. Teams with a vote choose their own representatives.  
  - The council oversees the executive committee and can remove appointees by vote.  
  - Any member of the council can propose a vote. Not all CAJA proceedings or activities require a vote, but if a council member demands a vote on something then majority approval (simple majority, i.e. \>50%) is required for the motion to proceed.  

**Executive Committee:** Appointed members of the community, led by the CAJA Chairperson, who execute the primary functions of NJA. Positions and responsibilities are described in more detail below.  
  - Any CAJA community member is eligible to serve on the committee, even if they’re not on an active team.  
  - Committee appointees can be nominated by themselves or any other community member. All appointees require approval by majority council vote.  
  - Committee positions are held for 1 year or until resignation or removal by council vote, whatever comes first. There are presently no term limits.  
  - Committee members may not simultaneously be on the voting council.

### EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE POSITIONS
Specific roles and responsibilities of the executive committee positions are described below. While certain committee members may have assistants, the official committee always comprises only five. This is to avoid organizational bloat and diffusion of accountability. New positions may be added as the organization grows and evolves, as deemed necessary by the voting council.

**Chairperson:** Administrative head of CAJA.

 - Accountability: Primary liaison between executive committee and the voting council. Subservient to the council, and responsible for making sure other committee members fulfill their roles.  
 - Public communications: Spokesperson and point person for CAJA to jugger community in CA and beyond.  
 - CAJA meetings: Schedule, plan, and moderate regularly scheduled CAJA meetings. Coordinate additional meetings with the executive committee as needed.  
 - CAJA management: Delegate tasks to committee members as appropriate, and support them in these tasks.

**SECRETARY:** Administrative assistant to the Chairperson.

 - Accountability: Communicate with and be accountable to the Chairperson. This includes attending meetings when asked.  
 - CAJA meetings: Assist the Chairperson with planning CAJA meetings. This includes scheduling and making an agenda.  
 - Agenda management: Solicit teams and general community for agenda items, and publicize agendas prior to meetings in a timely fashion.  
 - Meeting minutes: Record minutes during CAJA meetings and present them in a clean and readable fashion to the general community afterwards to uphold organizational transparency.  
 - Records keeping: Establish and maintain records of CAJA proceedings for future reference, as well as other important organizational documentation (e.g. a centralized Google Drive).

**CHIEF EVENT COORDINATOR:** Game day and tournament-related tasks.

 - Accountability: Communicate with and be accountable to the Chairperson. This includes attending meetings when asked.  
 - CAJA Events: Organize CAJA events, especially game days. This includes date/time/location logistics, hour-by-hour scheduling, competitive formats (round robin, brackets, individual events, etc.), event announcements, etc.  
 - Local tournaments: Support CAJA member teams if they organize their own events, e.g. Fog of War hosted by Ursae Majoris. This might entail enlisting help from non-hosting teams, as well as compiling general tournament resources, e.g. lists of local parks, contact numbers for insurance and field reservations, systems for round-robin/bracket assignment, etc.  
 - Out-of-state tournaments: Help organize traveling teams of CAJA players in the event member teams don’t sort their own rosters.  
 - Rulebook management: Keep and update the rulebook to be used by CAJA member teams. Major rulebook changes and decisions will be decided by the voting council with community input.  
 - Assistants: May gather assistant coordinators to help with the above responsibilities (subject to council approval).

**CHIEF OF ADVERTISING/OUTREACH:** Community growth and outreach.

 - Accountability: Communicate with and be accountable to the Chairperson. This includes attending meetings when asked.  
 - Advertising: Use social media and other means to broaden public exposure to jugger, enable easy access to the community, and direct interested people to the teams in their areas.  
 - Outreach: Coordinate with other interest groups (e.g. LARP, HEMA, fencing, kendo, etc.) as needed. This may come at the request of the Chairperson, council, community members, etc  
 - Account management: Manage existing accounts and create new ones on different platforms as needed to fulfill the general goals of this position.  
 - Assistants: May gather advertising/outreach assistants to help with the above responsibilities (subject to council approval).

**WEBMASTER:** Online community management.

 - Accountability: Communicate with and be accountable to the Chairperson. This includes attending meetings when asked.  
 - Online community moderator: Set rules for CAJA Discord and maintain online community health/standards/discipline.  
 - Server transition: Facilitate transition from current Ursae Majoris Discord server to a CAJA server. Ursae Majoris has plans to make a separate Discord server for team-internal affairs, which is  - yond the scope of this position.  
 - Assistants: May gather assistant moderators to help with the above responsibilities, (subject to council approval).

The listed responsibilities are intended to give an idea of what each position might look like in an idealized scenario. The specifics will shift and evolve with time and individual tenures. Right now, the only non-negotiable facet is accountability, whether to the council or CAJA Chairperson. In the end we’re all volunteers who care about jugger and our community, so there should be little we can’t sort out through good-faith discussion.

## CAJA MEETINGS
The CAJA executive committee may meet informally at its discretion, but all major decisions require approval of the voting council via a live vote. The voting council and executive committee are expected to convene at least once every few months, and members of all CAJA-affiliated teams may attend. An ideal meeting is structured approximately as follows:

1. **Prior:** Voting council or executive committee members submit topics for discussion to the Secretary. The Secretary posts a meeting agenda to the CAJA Discord server, ideally a few days before the scheduled meeting.  
2. **Day of:** The Chairperson (or pre-appointed substitute) initiates the meeting and takes a quorum. Not all council or committee members are required to attend every meeting, but major decisions can only be made with council majority approval during a vote with sufficient voting members present. The Chairperson moderates the meeting per the agenda, prioritizing topics at their discretion. The Secretary takes minutes and notes on discussions and votes.  
3. **After:** The Secretary submits minutes to the council in the CAJA Discord server, and optionally also to public channels for all California members. The Chairperson and Secretary schedule the next CAJA meeting with input from those expected to be present.

## EDITING THE CHARTER
This charter is expected to change as CAJA grows. The process for making edits is as follows:
1. Anyone makes changes to this document by editing it and committing the changes to a new branch[^1]. The branch should follow the naming convention `<author-name>/<change-description>`.
2. When they are satisfied with the changes, they create a pull request on github and publicize this to (at least) the members of the voting council. The pull request must include, at a minimum:
     - A brief summary of the changes made
     - Why the changes are believed to be necessary
3. Anyone may discuss the changes and provide feedback or suggestions in the comments of the pull request.
4. At the next CAJA general meeting, the voting council votes to determine the status of the pull request. They must choose to
     - Close the pull request (reject the changes)
     - Merge the pull request (accept the changes)
     - Abstain
   Both actions - close or merge - require a 2/3 majority to pass. If this does not happen, the pull request remains open for comments and updates, and the vote is deferred until the next general meeting.


[^1]: If editing via the github web interface, on your first commit, select the "Create a **new branch** for this commit and start a pull request" option instead of "Commit directly to the `main` branch". Enter your new branch's name in the text box. After you click "Propose Changes", it will take you to a page where you can make your pull request. If you're not ready to make a pull request, you can just go back to editing the charter - your changes will be kept. On subsequent changes, you can just keep the "Commit directly to the `your-branch-name` branch" option.
